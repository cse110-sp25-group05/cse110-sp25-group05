- Working on setting up small groups and new repo with issues to be organized
- Will be building more slowly but efficiently
- More meetings every other day at 8 pm
- Assign people to tasks
- Connect more issues tgt, make them more like subtasks so people don't have to wait for code to be completed
- Autonomy and impact was very high but clarity wasnâ€™t
- Hard for inexperienced people to do a lot of work
