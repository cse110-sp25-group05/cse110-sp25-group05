# Stand Up 5/21

May 21th, 8:20pm

Attendees: Emily, Renee, Ruyi, Aaron, Ibrahim, Omar, Abu

## Logistical stuff

* Must keep work in main group repo (i.e., [cse110-sp25-group05](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group05/cse110-sp25-group05))

* Team for each big issue... each team creates their own sub issues and works on them chronologically  
    
* Emily will create issues and assign people to issues  
    
* Next meeting: Friday (5/23) @ 8pm

## Tasks

Next steps: 

* polishing cards (adding KPOP group photos, fonts / text)  
* starting sticker decoration (separate decoration page, drag stickers onto cards, updates transfer to user’s collection once finished)

example:  

Stretch goals (next sprint?):

* Credit / currency system that limits how many packs user can open  
  * How are credits earned? Minigames, rock paper scissors, tic tac toe, etc.
