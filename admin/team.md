### Jonathan Ty

Hello! My name is Jonathan Ty, I'm a second-year Computer Science major with a minor in Cognitive Science! I've had experience in frontend development and UI/UX design, but I'm open to anything when it comes to backend (JavaScript, SQL, etc.). In my free time, I enjoy going on runs 🏃‍♂️, listening to music 🎶, and board games 🎲.
