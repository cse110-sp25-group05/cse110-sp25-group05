To run our project click the link above. You are given a base amount of credits at the beginning that can be used to summon different cards. We currently have six packs implemented, and specifics can be found in the pack descriptions. You can earn more credits by heading over to the `Minigames` tab where you can play different games to earn credits. You can view your entire collection in the `My Collection` tab. Also, you can decorate collected cards in the `Decorations` tab. Here you can select a card to decorate and then drag and drop stickers onto the card. You can also hide the UI by clicking `Screenshot Mode`.
