# Starting Pitch

K-POP Photo Card Web Application | Group 5 | Code Blooded | CSE 110

# **Statement of Purpose**

Our app is designed to gamify and enhance collecting K-pop photocards, making it more engaging, interactive, and accessible to fans. Recognizing the immense passion and community spirit within the K-pop fandom, we aim to transform photocard collecting from a traditional, often costly, physical activity into a fun digital experience.

# **Risks/Rabbit Holes**

- Risks
    - Privacy/data concerns: if users are creating a profile to keep track of the cards collected we need to ensure we are securing their data
        - Note: Not sure if allowing users to make a profile or trade amongst each other was a component we wanted to include
    - Data management/scope: there are lots of K-POP groups, each having many members and albums so if we don’t narrow down which groups to focus on there will be many photocards that need to be made
        - Example: could narrow it down to a handful of female groups and their most popular albums
    - IP issues: If this was an app/game to publish, this could lead to legal problems and copyright issues.
- Rabbit Holes
    - “Collect” or “trade” features could be more difficult to implement
        - Notifications or chat system being implemented?
    - UI/UX: many K-POP fans have a higher expectation for cute/aesthetic designs, trying to satisfy this could lead to a lot of time spent on design
        - Risks less time and focus spent on testing or other aspects of the project
    - Scope: The idea captures so many things as there are many systems involving the photo card/collection/gacha idea.
        - How many groups and albums will be covered? If too many, it could lead to large amounts of work.
        - What systems will we put in the app? Too many systems may multiply work, as each card would need to be worked on the system.
