# Decide Decoration System For K-Pop Card Collecting App

## Context and Problem Statement

We have only a couple of weeks left to ship our K-Pop card app. One of our goals is to bring the user a better experience through the option of decorating the cards they collect. **Which features should we implement to bring the user a fun decorating experience?**

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* **Course Deadline** - working demo due Week 10, which is quickly approaching 
* **User Experience** - want to implement features that a K-Pop fan would want on a physical photo card
* **Team Capacity** - subgroups of the project team will work to implement the design and development of the cards

## Considered Options

* Stickers
* Frames 

## Decision Outcome

Chose the sticker and frame options because they are a common way to add unique design to K-Pop photo cards. 

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, because the user will likely enjoy being able to channeling their creativity and have further interaction with the app. 
* Bad, because designing stickers/frames may take more time. If we use images instead for the frames/stickers, ,members may spend a lot of time looking through images. 

Implementation tickets are open on Github for the polish-deco team members to self-assign to. 

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Stickers (chosen)

* Good, because fairly simple way to bring variability to the app.
* Bad, because members may try to provide too many stickers, leading to more time being spent on the feature than necessary.

### Frames (chosen) 

* Good, because brings variability to the app and enhances user interaction.
* Bad, because users may frequently ask for more frame options.
