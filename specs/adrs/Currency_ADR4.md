# Currency System to Pull Cards

## Context and Problem Statement

After we finished our inital demo, we wanted to make getting cards a bit more difficult so users wouldn't be able to pull all the cards very fast. How could we slow down the users ability to recieve cards?

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

- Prevent users from collecting all cards too quickly
- Add a sense of progression and reward
- Keep the experience fun and not overly restrictive



## Considered Options

* Implement a timer, packs can only be pulled after X mins, hours, etc.
* Introduce a coin-based currency system where users earn coins through actions (e.g., completing tasks, logging in daily) and spend them to pull cards
* Limit the number of cards that can be pulled per day without a currency system

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Coin-based currency system, because it gives users a clear path for progression, allows us to give team members more chances to participate, and keeps users returning without hard-blocking their actions. We initially are implementing RPS, TicTacToe, LuckyDie, but may implement other games, milestones, and login trackers, if we have the time to.
